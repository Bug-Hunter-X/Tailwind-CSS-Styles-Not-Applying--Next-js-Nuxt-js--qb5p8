# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying (Next.js/Nuxt.js)

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS within Next.js or Nuxt.js projects: styles failing to apply correctly due to build process or configuration problems.

## Bug Description

Styles defined using Tailwind CSS classes may not be rendered, partially rendered, or produce unexpected results. This often manifests when building the application, and can stem from incorrect configurations, missing dependencies or improperly configured build processes. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run the development server (using `npm run dev` or similar).
4. Observe that the expected styling is not applied to elements in the user interface.
