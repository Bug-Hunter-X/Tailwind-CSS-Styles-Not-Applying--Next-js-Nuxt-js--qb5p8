To fix this, ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and integrated into your project. First, verify that the Tailwind directives (`@tailwind directives`) are included in your main CSS file (typically `globals.css` or `styles.css`).
Second, check that your CSS file is correctly imported into your application's main layout or app component.  Make sure you have all necessary plugins correctly set up within your `tailwind.config.js` file. In Next.js projects, ensure you are importing the CSS file correctly in the `_app.js` file. In Nuxt.js, you might need to configure the Tailwind plugin appropriately in `nuxt.config.js`.

If the problem persists, review the build logs carefully for any errors or warnings related to Tailwind CSS. Consider rebuilding the project from scratch, ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed, and double-check your Tailwind configuration for accuracy and completeness.  If you're using a framework's pre-configured Tailwind setup, ensure that it aligns with your project structure and requirements.  Updating your framework or Tailwind may solve compatibility problems.  If you use PurgeCSS, make sure that your PurgeCSS configuration allows for the necessary styles to pass through.
